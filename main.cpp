 * @title 			Tower of Hanoi
 * @date			2017-02-18(YYYY-MM-DD)
 * @fversion		1.3.3
 * @description 	(FROM WIKIPEDIA) TOH consists of three rods, and a number of
						disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The
						puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending 
						order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus
						making a conical shape.
					The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to
						another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
							Only one disk can be moved at a time.
							Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of
								the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e.
								a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk
								on a stack.
							No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
					The minimum number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi
						puzzle is 2^n â€“ 1, where n is the number of disks.
